    <h2>Cold War</h2>
    <p>The Cold War is a term commonly used to refer to a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and
        the Soviet Union and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc. Historians do not fully
        agree on its starting and ending points, but the period is generally considered to span from the announcement of
        <a href="#nowehre">the Truman Doctrine</a> on 12 March 1947 to the dissolution of the Soviet Union on 26 December 1991.[1] The term
        cold war is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each
        supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars. The conflict was based around the ideological and
        geopolitical struggle for global influence by these two superpowers, following their temporary alliance and
        victory against Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945.[2] Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and
        conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as
        psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events, and
        technological competitions such as the Space Race.</p>
