        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>While most historians trace the origins of the Cold War to the period immediately following World War II,
            some
            argue that it began with the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 when the Bolsheviks took power. In World
            War
            I, the British, French and Russian Empires had composed the major Allied Powers from the start, and the US
            joined them as a self-styled Associated Power in April 1917. The Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in
            November
            1917 and fulfilled their promise to withdraw from WWI, and German armies advanced rapidly across the
            borderlands. <span class="tag">The Allies</span> responded with an economic blockade against all of
            Russia.[9] In early March 1918,
            the
            Soviets followed through on the wave of popular disgust against the war and accepted harsh German peace
            terms
            with <span>the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk</span>. In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany to
            win the war
            by
            freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front[10] and by relinquishing much of Russia's food
            supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe.[11][12] According to
            historian
            Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt, "The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the
            seeds
            for the Cold War. With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become
            reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention," and proceeded to step up
            their "economic warfare" against the Bolsheviks.[9] Some Bolsheviks saw Russia as only the first step,
            planning
            to incite revolutions against capitalism in every western country, but the need for peace with Germany led
            Soviet leader <span class="tag">Vladimir Lenin</span> away from this position.[C]</p>
